The microcontroller (MCU) code is located in the iot_pitmaster_mcu folder. There is a special README in that folder specifically used for getting started with the MCU.

The printed circuit board (PCB) design is located in the iot_pitmaster_pcb folder. We used Altium as our PCB design software.

The Android code has been copied over to the iot_pitmaster_android folder.
